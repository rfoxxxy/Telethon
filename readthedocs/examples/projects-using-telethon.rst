Projects using Telethon
=======================

This page lists some **interesting and useful** real world
examples showcasing what can be built with the library.

.. note::

    Do you have an interesting project that uses the library or know of any
    that's not listed here? Feel free to leave a comment at
    `issue 744 <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/issues/744>`_
    so it can be included in the next revision of the documentation!

    You can also advertise your bot and its features, in the issue, although
    it should be a big project which can be useful for others before being
    included here, so please don't feel offended if it can't be here!
